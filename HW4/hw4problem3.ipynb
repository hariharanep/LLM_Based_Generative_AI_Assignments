[1], incorporating three main tools: search, compare, and analyze. This agent should be able to handle complex queries by reasoning about which tool to use and when.\n\na) (4 points) Implement the search tool using the SerpAPI integration from previous questions. Ensure it can be easily used by the ReAct agent.\n   - Proper integration with SerpAPI\n   - Formatting the search results for use by the ReAct agent\n\nb) (5 points) Create a custom comparison tool using LangChain's `Tool` class. The tool should accept multiple items and a category as input and return a comparison result.\n   - Implementing the comparison logic\n   - Creating an appropriate prompt template for the comparison\n   - Proper error handling for invalid inputs\n\nc) (5 points) Implement an analysis tool that can summarize and extract key information from search results or comparisons. This tool should use the OpenAI model to generate insightful analyses.\n   - Implementing the analysis logic\n   - Creating an appropriate prompt template for the analysis\n   - Ensuring the analysis output is concise and relevant\n\nd) (6 points) Integrate these tools with a ReAct agent using LangChain. Your implementation should:\n   - Use LangChain's `initialize_agent` function with the `AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` agent type\n   - Include all three tools (search, compare, analyze) as available actions for the agent\n   - Implement proper error handling and fallback strategies\n   - Ensure smooth transitions between tools in the agent's reasoning process\n\ne) (5 points) Implement a simple Streamlit user interface for your ReAct agent. Your implementation should include:\n   - A text input field for users to enter their queries\n   - A button to submit the query and trigger the ReAct agent\n   - A display area for showing the final results\n   - A section to display the step-by-step reasoning process of the ReAct agent","metadata":{"id":"Zj9UG72nneAJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install required packages\n!pip install -q \"langchain>=0.2.10\" \"langchain-openai>=0.2.10\" \"langchain-community>=0.2.10\" \"google-search-results\" \"streamlit\"","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"GYINe7f5o2ts","outputId":"a663dc19-1767-4e6c-e334-ba4a1485019e","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-19T00:32:39.104017Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-19T00:32:39.104553Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-19T00:32:49.704677Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-19T00:32:39.104523Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-19T00:32:49.703979Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m76.0/76.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m2.5/2.5 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m38.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0ma \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m10.2/10.2 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m94.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m:00:01\u001b[0m0:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m449.8/449.8 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m31.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m6.9/6.9 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m103.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25h  Building wheel for google-search-results (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import necessary libraries\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType\nfrom langchain.tools import Tool\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\n# Set API keys\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = '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'\nos.environ[\"SERPAPI_API_KEY\"] = 'bdd56e9df6bb98875430f428df033decd2286bed67432865a1a1213314345f80'\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Initialize the OpenAI language model\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)","metadata":{"id":"UoG8eGynneAL","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-19T00:33:14.536050Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-19T00:33:14.536335Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-19T00:33:24.512318Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-19T00:33:14.536310Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-19T00:33:24.511481Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## a) Implement the search tool","metadata":{"id":"9YsEDSkNneAM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the search tool using SerpAPI\nsearch_tool = load_tools([\"serpapi\"], llm=llm)","metadata":{"id":"hSqY-ZEkneAM","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-19T00:33:28.600050Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-19T00:33:28.600914Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-19T00:33:28.609002Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-19T00:33:28.600885Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-19T00:33:28.608208Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## b) Create a custom comparison tool","metadata":{"id":"FxZgkYH5neAN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import json\ndef compare_items(query: str) -> str:\n    # Extract items and category from the query\n    extraction_prompt = PromptTemplate(\n        input_variables=[\"query\"],\n        template=\"\"\"Reason about the query and come up with at least two items to compare and the comparison category from this query.\n        Query: {query}\n        CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Your complete code implementation for the ReAct agent and its tools.\n2. A sample question that you used to test your tool (make it complex enough to demonstrate the use of multiple tools).\n3. The final answer provided by your ReAct agent for the sample question.\n4. The complete history traces of the ReAct agent for your sample question, showing its thought process, actions, and observations. Your traces should follow a format similar to this example:\n\n```\nThought: I need to find information about top smartphones first\nAction: Search[top smartphones 2023]\nObservation: [Search results about top smartphones]\nThought: Now I should compare the top two options\nAction: Compare[iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, smartphones]\nObservation: [Comparison result]\nThought: I should analyze this comparison for the user\nAction: Analyze[comparison result]\nObservation: [Analysis of the comparison]\nFinal Answer: [Your agent's final response to the user's query]\n```\n\nEnsure that your submission clearly demonstrates the agent's ability to reason about which tool to use and how to interpret the results from each tool. Your history traces should show a logical flow of thoughts, actions, and observations, culminating in a final answer that addresses the initial query.\n\n**Note:** Ensure that your ReAct agent can seamlessly switch between these tools based on the task at hand. The agent should be able to reason about which tool to use next and how to interpret the results from each tool.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Yao, S., Zhao, J., Yu, D., Du, N., Shafran, I., Narasimhan, K., & Cao, Y.
