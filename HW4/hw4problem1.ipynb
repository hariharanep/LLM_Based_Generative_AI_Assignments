To improve the inferences, you will explore a full fine-tuning approach and evaluate the results with ROUGE metrics.

PEFT is a form of instruction fine-tuning that is much more efficient than full fine-tuning - with comparable evaluation results as you will see soon.\n\nPEFT is a generic term that includes **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** and prompt tuning (which is NOT THE SAME as prompt engineering!). In most cases, when someone says PEFT, they typically mean LoRA. LoRA, at a very high level, allows the user to fine-tune their model using fewer compute resources (in some cases, a single GPU). After fine-tuning for a specific task, use case, or tenant with LoRA, the result is that the original LLM remains unchanged and a newly-trained “LoRA adapter” emerges. This LoRA adapter is much, much smaller than the original LLM - on the order of a single-digit % of the original LLM size (MBs vs GBs).  \n\nThat said, at inference time, the LoRA adapter needs to be reunited and combined with its original LLM to serve the inference request.  The benefit, however, is that many LoRA adapters can re-use the original LLM which reduces overall memory requirements when serving multiple tasks and use cases.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a name='3.1'></a>\n### 3.1 - Setup the PEFT/LoRA model for Fine-Tuning (2 points)\n\nYou need to set up the PEFT/LoRA model for fine-tuning with a new layer/parameter adapter.

In addition, the peft model surprisingly captures the conversation better than both the finetuned model and the original model. Unlike the finetuned model, the peft model is able to identify that the conversation is a  third-party conversation. Maybe the fully finetuned model was overfitting and the peft model is able to generalize much better than the fully finetuned model due to the reduction in model size.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a name='3.4'></a>\n### 3.4 - Evaluate the Model Quantitatively (with ROUGE Metric) (3 points)\nPerform inferences for the sample of the test dataset (only 10 dialogues and summaries to save time).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get 10 test set dialogues and their labels\ndialogues = dataset['test'][40:50]['dialogue']\nhuman_baseline_summaries = dataset['test'][40:50]['summary']\n\noriginal_model_summaries = []\ninstruct_model_summaries = []\npeft_model_summaries = []\n\nfor idx, dialogue in enumerate(dialogues):\n    prompt = \"Summarize the following conversation.\\n\\n\" + dialogue + \"\\n\\nSummary:\"\n\n    # Move input_ids to the same device as the model\n    input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(device)\n\n    # Get text output from original model\n    original_model_response = original_model.generate(input_ids)\n    original_model_outputs = original_model_response[0]\n    original_model_text_output = original_tokenizer.decode(\n        original_model_outputs,\n        skip_special_tokens=True\n    )\n    \n    # Get text output from instruct finetuned model\n    instruct_model_response = instruct_model.generate(input_ids)\n    instruct_model_outputs = instruct_model_response[0]\n    instruct_model_text_output = instruct_tokenizer.decode(\n        instruct_model_outputs,\n        skip_special_tokens=True\n    )\n\n    # Get text output from peft model\n    peft_model_response = peft_model.generate(input_ids=input_ids)\n    peft_model_outputs = peft_model_response[0]\n    peft_model_text_output = peft_tokenizer.decode(\n        peft_model_outputs,\n        skip_special_tokens=True\n    )\n\n    # append the model outputs to their respective lists\n    original_model_summaries.append(original_model_text_output)\n    instruct_model_summaries.append(instruct_model_text_output)\n    peft_model_summaries.append(peft_model_text_output)\n\nzipped_summaries = list(zip(human_baseline_summaries, original_model_summaries, instruct_model_summaries, peft_model_summaries))\n\n# display the outputs of all the models as a pandas dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame(zipped_summaries, columns = ['human_baseline_summaries', 'original_model_summaries', 'instruct_model_summaries', 'peft_model_summaries'])\ndf","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-15T19:28:52.659996Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-15T19:28:52.660296Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-15T19:29:02.523449Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-15T19:28:52.660275Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-15T19:29:02.522666Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":104,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                            human_baseline_summaries  \\\n0  #Person1# is in a hurry to catch a train.
