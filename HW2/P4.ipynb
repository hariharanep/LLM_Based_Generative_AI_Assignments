His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An Lushan Rebellion of 755 , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest .', ', nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the \" Poet @-@ Historian \" and the \" Poet @-@ Sage \" by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as \" the Chinese Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , Wordsworth , Béranger , Hugo or Baudelaire \" .', 'posits between art and morality \" . Since many of Du Fu \\'s poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William Hung , is that Chinese poems are typically concise , omitting context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , \" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether \" . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet \\'s work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the \" reductive \" categorizations used for more limited poets .', \"of Empress Wu . Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near Luoyang , Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ) . In later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an , ancestral hometown of the Du family .\"]\n"

       "'\\nAs stated in the comments, the distinctN metrics store the proportion of unique ngrams among the generated words. The goal in contrastive decoding is to produce more diverse output so according to the table shown above, the (1.0 = temperature, None = context window restriction) and (1.0 = temperature, 512 = context window restriction) configurations produces the best/highest distinct1 score, the (1.0 = temperature, None = context window restriction) and (1.0 = temperature, 512 = context window restriction) configurations produces the best/highest distinct2 score, the (0.5 = temperature, None = context window restriction) and (0.5 = temperature, 512 = context window restriction) configurations produces the best/highest distinct3 score, the (1.5 = temperature, None = context window restriction) and (1.5 = temperature, 512 = context window restriction) configurations produces the best/highest mauve scores, and the (0.5 = temperature, 1.0 = context window restriction) configuration produces the best/lowest perplexity score. It’s kind of hard to choose which configuration is best since the performance of all the configurations across each metric kind of varies, but I guess the (1.0 = temperature, None = context window restriction) and (1.0 = temperature, 512 = context window restriction) configurations for contrastive decoding produced the best overall results since they achieved the best overall scores for the most metrics. In general, apart from the best perplexity score observed for the (0.5 = temperature, 1.0 = context window restriction) configuration, it seems like an increase in temperature drastically improves the perplexity and makes the overall system more confident about the tokens it selects. This makes sense since increasing the temperature will make the amateur model distribution flatter causing the system to not penalize the higher probability tokens as much leading to a less diverse output where the system is more confident in each token. This result is similar to what was presented in the results for the original paper except the original paper used coherence instead of perplexity. In addition, the higher temperature values(1.0 and 1.5) tend to help the system choose tokens more similar to the true human generated text provided in the prompt labels as seen in the relatively high mauve scores produced under these conditions. This is different from the results observed in the paper which show that lower temperature values >= 0.5 produce a higher mauve score than the higher temperature values(1.0, 1.5). One other major takeaway I saw was how the distinctN values generally increase when the temperature changes from 0.5 to 1 but then generally decrease when the temperature changes from 1 to 1.5. This is also different from the results observed in the paper which show that the diversity of the results should actually decrease as temperature goes up since the amateur model distribution should be flatter which causes the higher probability tokens to still be favored more. One other thing I noticed in the results was that the context window restriction mattered for the diversityN metrics. Whenever the context window was decreased to just the most previous token, the diversityN metric always decreased by a considerable amount. Finally, there wasn’t really any difference between the metrics for when the context window restriction was None and when the context window restriction was half of the full context window which indicates that we probably don’t need the full context window in predicting the next token and having access to just half the full context window is suitable for predicting the next token.\\n'"
